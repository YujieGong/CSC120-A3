Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
I cosulted with Zhirou about the instructions of the homework. At first, I didn't get what should be the output after user input, and what it means to mirror it to other words. Zhirou explains to me and also we talks a bout some basic logic we should use when coding this assingnment, which is really helpful. 

I also worked with Vivian when I'm working on the assignment. Before talking with her, my code does not have the boolean expression as a condition of loop, so my code cannot return another sentence if the user's input does not include anyone of the mirrored words. Vivian inspired me to add a boolean expression and use an if statement to make the cope output another random sentence when user's input does not have the mirrored words. 


- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
I attended the TA hours on Tursday morning. I consulted how to write the mirror strings and Professor Jordan explains the steps of how to write it, which helps me a lot and gives a basic structure of how to write the code. 

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
I found it a bit hard to change from python to java because it changes for mostly procedual coding to object-oriented coding. But as I start to write it, and try to think in a more object-oriented way, I feel like that actually makes coding easier in some way. 

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
One difference is procedual and objected oriented. Also java has a different syntax from python. 
But actually I feel like there are more similarties than difference, like the logic of coding is the same, I need to have a structure and write some psudocode to start with and start to transfer it to either java or python language. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
My code works for most inputs, but if the user inputs you, it cannot differentiate between I and am. Also, what I feel is that my code has too many if statements, I'm thinking about if there a way to testify all mirrored words at the same time, but I cannot come up with a solution.
